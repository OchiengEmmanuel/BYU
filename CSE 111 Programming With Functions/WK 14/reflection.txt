Course: CSE 111 | Programming with Functions
Semester: Winter 2024


Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    One key take-away I had about functions is the ability to try and solve problems by breaking them into
    manageable tasks and creating functions for each of these tasks. This helped me not to clutter my brain with 
    the complexity of the program but rather perform one task at a time them combine them later on. I applied this 
    while working on my final class project about the Guessing Game.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    The value of test functions is priceless based on what I have seen through this course. I can use test 
    functions to confirm the correctness of my program by testing each function of my code. I have used test 
    functions to validate the behavior of some components of my code and determine the functionalities of
    my codes. It also helps determine if there are any inconsistencies on my main program.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    The process to troubleshooting and fixing a program starts with understanding what the error message it.
    Another step is to create print messages in strategic places in the code to help find the mistakes. I can 
    also write and run test functions for logic errors. In order improve the process I can use a debugger 
    to help me watch as the computer execute the statement in the program.
