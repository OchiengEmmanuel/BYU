# Example 9
# PermissionError

"""
    Nearly all computer operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, 
    Mac OS X, and Linux, allow multiple people to use a single 
    computer. Because people need to store private data in files on 
    a computer, the operating systems implement file access permission 
    rules. These rules help to prevent unauthorized access to files.

    If we write a call to the open function that attempts to open a 
    file and the person executing our program doesnâ€™t have permission 
    to access the file, the computer will raise a PermissionError. 
    Example 9 contains code where such an error might occur

            for row in contacts_file:
